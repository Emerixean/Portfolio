# Portfolio: Basic Introduction
	I am  Cordale Parker.
I am a current student at Jacksonville State University.
In my time at Jacksonville State I have studied in various programming languages.
These languages include: Python, C, C++, and Java. As part of my academic education
I have written various programs that perform many diverse tasks. This portfolio is a showcase of 
what I have learned during my time at Jacksonville State.
Consisting of two programs, one program a practice in visual output, the other focusing on
data manipulation, this portfolio is a demonstration of the languages and programming techniques I have
aquired in my education thus far.
