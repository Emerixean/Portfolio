##### Program 2: A Game of Hangman
This program is written in the C++ language. This program runs a simple version of hangman with which you can play along. The purpose for this program is to practice handling constantly changing arrays of data. The data that changes is never consistent as players can guess whatever they want. The main focus of this program is to create a robust system that can handle input that could potentially lead to errors while keeping a game running.
