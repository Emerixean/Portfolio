# Portfolio: Basic Introduction
	I am  Cordale Parker.
I am a current student at Jacksonville State University.
In my time at Jacksonville State I have studied in various programming languages.
These languages include: Python, C, C++, and Java. As part of my academic education
I have written various programs that perform many diverse tasks. This portfolio is a demonstration of 
what I have learned during my time at Jacksonville State.
Consisting of two programs, one program a practice in visual output, the other focusing on
data manipulation, this portfolio showcases of two programs that I have coded. The two programs show the programming techniques and knowledge I have aquired being applied in practical ways.

##### Program 1: Visual Output in Java
The goal of this program was to garner practice in developing visual based programs.
The program is designed to create three basic shapes, circles, triangles, and rectangles, of random
sizes and positions on a canvas. This is accomplished by creating *classes* in Java.
Since Java is an *object-oriented* language these classes serve as templates that can be used
to construct objects, or in this instance, shapes. By choosing the shapes randomly from 1-3, then 
generating random numbers to fill in the measurements of the shapes, the program can generate any
number of any shapes of any size at any position. The program then moves on to create a canvas upon which
it will paint these shapes. The program proceeds to look at each shape individually. It determines in which order 
the shapes will need to be painted by their assigned priorities of 1-9. Beginning at 1, the program begins to paint
the shapes onto a canvas in their designated colors. For this program, circles are represented in yellow, 
triangles in green, and rectangles in red. By utilizing the dimensions of each shape, the program is able to
correctly draw the shapes to scale of each other. As a finishing touch, the program then calculates the total
area of each shape and displays it in the center of the shape. The end result looks similar to this:
